Contributing Flow
------------------

1. Fork the latest version of [ULTRA](https://github.com/ULTR-Community/ULTRA/) into your repo.
2. Create an issue under [ULTR-Community/ULTRA/](https://github.com/ULTR-Community/ULTRA/issues), write description about the bug/enhancement.
3. Clone your forked ULTRA into your machine, add your changes. 
4. Create json files in tests/test_settings/ (e.g.,tests/test_settings/test.json) to test models that have been changed. Please create separate json files to test each changed model.
5. Run `make test` to ensure all tests passed on your computer.
6. Run `make format` to use autopep8 to format your code.
7. Push to your forked repo, then send the pull request to the official repo. In pull request, you need to create a link to the issue you created using `#[issue_id]`, and describe what has been changed.
8. We'll assign reviewers to review your code.


Your PR will be merged if:
- Functionally benefit for the project.
- With proper docstrings, see codebase as examples.
- All reviewers approved your changes.
